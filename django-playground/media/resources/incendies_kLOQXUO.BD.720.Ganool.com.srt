1
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,055
I'm glad to see you.

2
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:10,376
Please.

3
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,800
THE TWINS

4
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:40,626
Last will and testament of
Dr. Nawal Marwan.

5
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:44,067
Opening of the will to
her two children,

6
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:48,130
Simon Marwan and Jeanne Marwan.

7
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,578
"In accordance with the will,

8
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:55,580
regulations and rights of
Nawal Marwan,

9
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:57,650
the notary, Jean Lebel,

10
00:04:57,785 --> 00:05:00,845
is named executor."

11
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:03,115
Hmm ... I must tell you here

12
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,088
that it was your mother's decision.

13
00:05:06,193 --> 00:05:10,493
I was personally against
it, but she insisted.

14
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:13,791
You know ...

15
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:17,961
... your mother was more
than an employee.

16
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:19,435
To my late wife and me

17
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,839
you felt more like part
of our family, so ...

18
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,368
I could not refuse.

19
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:31,114
Hum!
"All my assets are to be
shared between the twins,

20
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:32,515
Jeanne and Simon Marwan."

21
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:34,883
"The money is to be equitably
shared"

22
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:38,321
"My furniture distributed by
mutual agreement."

23
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:40,988
"Burial"

24
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,392
"Notary Jean Lebel will

25
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,796
bury me without a coffin, naked

26
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,129
and without prayers."

26
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:53,297
"My face turned towards the ground,
my back against the world."

27
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:58,973
"Tombstone and Epitaph"

28
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,004
"No headstone is to be
placed on my grave

29
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:02,513
and my name engraved nowhere."

30
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,914
"No epitaph is deserved for those
who do not keep their promises."

31
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:10,321
"To Jeanne and Simon"

32
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:13,723
"Childhood is like a knife
stuck in the throat

33
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:16,193
which cannot be removed easily."

34
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,933
"Jeanne, notary Lebel will
hand you an envelope."

35
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:28,200
"This envelope is for your father."

36
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,174
"Find him

37
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,109
and hand him the envelope."

38
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,916
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

39
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:40,542
I've heard enough.

40
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:45,692
Oh ... but it's not finished.

41
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:49,618
Continue.

42
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:54,257
"Simon, the notary will
hand you an envelope."

43
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:57,370
"This envelope is for your brother."

44
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:02,140
"Find him and hand it to him."

45
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,415
"When these envelopes
have been handed

46
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:13,246
to their addressees, a
letter will be given to you."

47
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,321
"When the silence is broken,
and the promise kept

48
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:19,619
a stone may be placed
on my grave

49
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,820
and my name engraved on
the stone."

50
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:39,811
I admit it's a bit strange.

51
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,179
Is there stuff to sign?

52
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:51,450
No, not today.

53
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:52,820
OK.

54
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,454
Thank you, Jean.

55
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,119
- Shall we?
- Wait.

56
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:03,664
You know, the history
of our father.

57
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:06,102
You know, we have no brother.

58
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:08,538
Why did you let her write this?

59
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:12,002
I understand your surprise.

60
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:14,375
It's ... it's very surprising.

61
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:15,481
Stop pretending to be innocent!

62
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,174
We know that we speak of, there is
nothing surprising in this.

63
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:20,548
We did not make these
things up, Simon...

64
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:21,984
They are part of a will.

65
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,647
There's that, too.

66
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:45,334
Well, this morning your mother
gave us something rather special.

67
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:48,039
We'll sleep on it, then ...

68
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,046
We'll meet again, huh?

69
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:52,651
I'll wait outside.
Thank you, Jean.

70
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:54,687
Sit down, Simon.

71
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:57,551
Look, Jean ...

72
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,387
your secretary, she loved
working for you.

73
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:05,159
She did this well all her
life, congratulations.

74
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:07,495
Your secretary, however, was also
my mother.

75
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:10,365
Then her job as a mother,
that's another story.

76
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:11,561
Simon ...

77
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,196
You can bury your secretary
in any way you wish.

78
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:16,934
But my mother, I want her
buried in the normal way.

79
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,669
For once in your fucking life

80
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,872
make it something normal.

81
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:24,239
This is not negotiable.

82
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:39,463
Take your time.

83
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,227
And come see me when Simon
has calmed down.

84
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,734
I know it's very unusual, but ...

85
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:54,736
your mother was not crazy, Jeanne.

86
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,126
We have a large family now.

87
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,340
She spoke of a traitor?

88
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:25,070
In a big family, there's always a dog.

89
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,806
How long will it be before we
find the traitor?

90
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:30,506
Fucking crazy woman!

91
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,084
I'll fix that with Jean.

92
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,624
Fix what?

93
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
We'll give her a
normal funeral.

94
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:48,468
We'll take care of her, then
I'll take care of you.

95
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,683
Where are you going?

96
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,978
You bury her any way you like!

97
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:07,643
Oh, stop!

98
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:10,980
You feel guilty because
you were not there

99
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:12,125
when she died.

100
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:14,056
You feel guilty because
you were there

101
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:15,491
when she had her accident.

102
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:18,187
You need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything!

103
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:20,026
I am not feeling guilty
about anything.

104
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,658
Do you realize the significance of
what he just read?

105
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:23,996
Well, she's gone!

106
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:26,037
It's over, I'm at peace!

107
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:32,804
I have fucking peace!

108
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,043
I'm at peace now.

109
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:44,316
Yes, I see.

110
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:52,395
Mathematics as you
have known so far

111
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:56,491
have aimed to achieve a precise
and definitive response

112
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:59,538
to precise and definitive problems.

113
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:03,164
Now, you are about to enter into
entirely different adventure.

114
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:05,767
The subject will be
intractable problems

115
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:07,504
that will always lead

116
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:10,549
to other problems just
as intractable.

117
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:13,413
People around you will
repeatedly insist

118
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:16,545
that what you are doing is
hopeless.

119
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:19,715
You'll have no argument
to defend yourself,

120
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,624
because they will be of an
overwelming complexity.

121
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,965
Welcome to pure mathematics,

122
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,091
the land of loneliness.

123
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:32,228
This is my assistant,

124
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,203
Miss Jeanne Marwan.

125
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:36,732
Hello!

126
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,778
We will start with the conjecture
of Syracuse.

127
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,087
What does your intuition
tell you?

128
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:57,093
Your intuition is always right.

129
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:59,459
That's why you got potential

130
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:01,999
to becoming a real mathematician.

131
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:04,763
But over there, you'll need help.

132
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,930
Do you have any family there?

133
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:12,138
- Contacts?
- It's ridiculous, Niv.

134
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,806
You've come to learn that
a) your father is alive;

135
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:18,008
and b) you have another brother.

136
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:19,243
This is ridiculous

137
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,753
What is ridiculous to question
the inevitable.

138
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,346
You need to know.

139
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:28,020
Otherwise, your mind
will never be at peace.

140
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,693
And peace of mind has nothing to
do with pure mathematics.

141
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:39,430
You need a starting point.

142
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,477
My father died during
the war in Daresh.

143
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:49,844
That's the unknown variable
in the equation.

144
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:52,975
You never start with the
unknown variable.

145
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:56,853
My mother used to speak about
a village

146
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,821
called Der Om, in Fouad.

147
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,324
She graduated in French

148
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,826
at the University of Daresh.

149
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:06,899
If she studied, there is hope.

150
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:10,993
Said Haidar.

151
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:13,731
You'll go knock on the
door Said Haidar

152
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:16,307
an old friend of mine who
teaches at Daresh.

153
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:18,343
You can trust him.

154
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,250
What are you doing?

155
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:19,483
Mom! Are you Okay?

156
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:25,362
Madam, that's my towel, please.

157
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,189
Mom?

158
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:31,169
Mom!

159
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:56,051
Mom?

160
00:17:58,131 --> 00:17:59,621
What happened?

161
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:03,735
Where's Jeanne?

162
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:08,229
Mom?

163
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:22,448
Does she suffer from migraines?

164
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,578
No.

165
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:25,884
- Memory loss?
- No.

166
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:28,153
Loss of balance?

167
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:29,318
No.

168
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:31,054
Absent-minded?

169
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:33,132
She's always absent.

170
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,666
No, she was never absent.

171
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,167
Wahab, come.

172
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,864
Just get out of my sister's way.

173
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:18,094
Son of refugees, where do you
think you're going?

174
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:25,943
Nicolas, stop!

175
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:27,538
Go back to your country.

176
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:29,679
Wahab!

177
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:33,343
We'll leave your hide
in your camps, believe me.

178
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,076
Give me.

179
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:37,622
- I want to kill her.
- It's mine to do.

180
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,057
You have sullied the
family honor.

181
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:43,627
- Enough!

182
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:46,460
Go home!

183
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,398
Go home!

184
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,373
Outside.

185
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:06,274
What have you done!

186
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:09,888
You have humilliated us!
You have sullied the
name of our family!

187
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:13,785
Why God have you plunged
us in the dark?

188
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:19,929
My God, what have you done?
Why did you do that?

189
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:22,966
What will I do with you!
You want me to kill you?

190
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:27,065
I'm pregnant, grandma.

191
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:31,269
- My God, everything is black.
Why?

192
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:33,639
Why have you done this?

193
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:36,645
Do I have to kill you?

194
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:39,784
What will I do with you?

195
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:00,594
Come.

196
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:05,231
Eat if you want your
child safe.

197
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:13,406
Listen to me.

198
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:16,574
There's nothing here for you.

199
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:20,678
I'll help after the birth.

200
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:22,946
I want you to go away.

201
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:28,459
You'll go to live with
your uncle Charbel.

202
00:23:29,462 --> 00:23:31,760
There, you'll go to school.

203
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:34,128
To learn to read,
to learn to think

204
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,360
out of this misery.

205
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:41,303
Promise me and I'll help you.

206
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,739
Promise me you'll go to school.

207
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:55,815
I promise you, grandmother.

208
00:23:58,324 --> 00:23:59,621
I promise.

209
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:04,372
Shh.

210
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:21,122
Shh.

211
00:26:41,153 --> 00:26:45,112
Look carefully at your mother.
You'll have to recognize her.

212
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:54,562
I'll find you one day.
I promise you, my heart.

213
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:07,803
Be careful.
Don't worry.

214
00:27:41,514 --> 00:27:43,982
Come on, it's time
for you to go.

215
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:49,110
I feel that something terrible
is coming ...

216
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:07,637
One day I'll find you, my son.

217
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:48,138
I received a message
from my friend Niv Cohen

218
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:50,333
but I can't help you

219
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:52,444
because at the time,

220
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:53,772
I taught

221
00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:57,280
History of Mathematics
in Paris.

222
00:29:57,449 --> 00:30:00,316
Specifically, the period

223
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:04,411
where Euler had
succeeded

224
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:06,457
to give the first

225
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,788
formal mathematical resolution

226
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:14,661
to the problem of the seven bridges
of Konigsberg, yes.

227
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,792
Diderot defied the Court

228
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:19,837
saying:

229
00:30:19,972 --> 00:30:21,030
"Gentlemen ..."

230
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:24,802
I-ft plus

231
00:30:24,977 --> 00:30:26,308
Equals zero.

232
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:29,474
So, God exists!"

233
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,982
Niv, Niv, Niv ...

234
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,061
Hello! Do you speak French?

235
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:52,067
- Yes, of course!
- Can I help you?

236
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:55,867
Uh, yes, I am looking for someone
who would have known this woman.

237
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:59,834
She studied here maybe
35 years ago.

238
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,404
Are you kidding me?

239
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:04,709
I wasn't even born.

240
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,011
Well, you're in the wrong
place...

241
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:08,312
I'm not kidding.

242
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,479
I'm sure you know someone
who can help me.

243
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:12,147
I have come from far away.

244
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:14,919
Please. Her name is Nawal Marwan.

245
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:25,530
You are very kind.

246
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,504
I'm not nice, I want
to get rid of you.

247
00:31:28,574 --> 00:31:30,166
Najat, that's me.

248
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,773
You have time to waste?

249
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:36,380
That tells me something.

250
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:40,918
She may have worked in the
campus newspaper.

251
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:43,444
It's been a long time.

252
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:50,051
People who leave usually
change identities.

253
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:54,732
It is striking nonetheless.

254
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:10,208
Your mother was photographed
in Kfar Ryat.

255
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:11,805
Look here.

256
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:16,110
This is a sign of Kfar Ryat.

257
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:20,057
It is a prison in the south.

258
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,256
You do not know Kfar Ryat?

259
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:27,422
- No.

260
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,000
You're definitely not from
here.

261
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:35,104
You don't know the South.

262
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:10,100
If the international community

263
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:14,004
does not intervene now

264
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:17,005
The refugees in overcrowded

265
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:23,044
camps at the border ...will be
massacred.

266
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:27,848
She has arrived.

267
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:29,119
OK.

268
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:31,992
We, the students, are oppose
against the Nationalist Party

269
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:34,497
that are trying to evict the refugees
across the borders.

270
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:35,997
The National Party supports

271
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:37,692
militias of the Christian right,

272
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:39,736
who make open threats against
the refugees.

273
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:41,863
In the South, the refugees
are now armed.

274
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:43,804
And have the support

275
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:48,209
of much of the country's Muslim
population.

276
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:51,544
But you ...you're a Christian.

277
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:54,174
We are for peace.

278
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,685
Religion has nothing
to do with it.

279
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:07,263
Nawal!

280
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:10,524
Put the radio!
They've come to close
the University!

281
00:34:10,702 --> 00:34:13,364
The Nationalists have
closed the campus!

282
00:34:28,787 --> 00:34:30,550
Nawal, come back.

283
00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:33,017
Stay here.

284
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:38,619
Uncle Charbel, the Nationalists
are closing the campus!

285
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:42,594
There will be clashes.

286
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:44,929
Stay with me.

287
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:04,815
There is shooting outside ...

288
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,719
To the table, girls!

289
00:35:08,894 --> 00:35:10,759
Mom, they're attacking
the university!

290
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:13,626
It's not a reason not to eat!

291
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:23,097
Aioua?

292
00:35:53,305 --> 00:35:56,604
Christian villages were attacked
in the South this morning.

293
00:35:56,775 --> 00:35:58,868
May God protect us!

294
00:35:59,044 --> 00:36:01,035
That's why they closed
the university.

295
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:04,546
In short time, it will
explode here as well.

296
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:11,020
We'll go to the mountain
until it calms down.

297
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,480
For how long?

298
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,217
We start tomorrow.

299
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:18,158
The rest of the family
is already there.

300
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,820
And the school?

301
00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:23,332
Anyway, the school will close.

302
00:36:23,835 --> 00:36:25,803
Only God knows how long.

303
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:27,566
And Le Journal?

304
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:29,897
Don't be afraid.

305
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:33,476
Le Journal can survive without
us for a while.

306
00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:37,339
But ideas only survive if someone
is there to defend them!

307
00:36:37,516 --> 00:36:39,313
Exactly, Rafqa.

308
00:36:40,385 --> 00:36:41,977
Exactly.

309
00:36:53,532 --> 00:36:56,194
There are only two orphanages
in the region.

310
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:58,200
I will join you soon.

311
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,531
You will not go there now!

312
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:04,705
You had promised Grandma you
would finish your studies.

313
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:06,400
You heard your father.

314
00:37:06,545 --> 00:37:09,571
It's going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps.

315
00:37:10,582 --> 00:37:12,049
The studies are finished.

316
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,382
I think of him every day.

317
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:20,218
That's my child.

318
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,189
I want to find him alive.

319
00:37:44,316 --> 00:37:46,784
I'm going to fetch
water from Shadia.

320
00:37:46,952 --> 00:37:49,216
Hurry, Nawal.

321
00:39:48,573 --> 00:39:50,370
- Your name?
- Nawal.

322
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:52,874
- Nawal what?
- Nawal Marwan.

323
00:39:53,712 --> 00:39:54,872
Where are you going?

324
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,247
South.

325
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:57,403
What for?

326
00:39:58,183 --> 00:39:59,912
To meet my husband.

327
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:23,359
Wahab.

328
00:42:50,055 --> 00:42:52,455
You have only daughters?

329
00:42:53,058 --> 00:42:55,891
The older boys are in Kfar
Kout.

330
00:42:58,363 --> 00:43:01,526
You should go with us.
Kfar Kout was attacked
yesterday.

331
00:44:31,523 --> 00:44:35,015
Looking for the orphanage.
You know where is it?

332
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:36,659
There.

333
00:44:37,629 --> 00:44:40,564
The children?
Where are the children?

334
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:43,898
You should speak with those
who were there.

335
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:49,472
The muslim villagers fled
to the camp Deressa.

336
00:44:49,974 --> 00:44:52,568
They fear reprisals will come.

337
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:56,139
The children may be with them.

338
00:44:58,016 --> 00:45:04,251
Chamseddine and his men killed all the
Christians to avenge the refugees.

339
00:45:06,357 --> 00:45:10,088
Perhaps the children are in Deressa.

340
00:46:33,645 --> 00:46:35,613
Can you take me to the camp in Deressa?

341
00:50:38,689 --> 00:50:40,156
I am a Christian.

342
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,730
My daughter! My daughter!

343
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:02,774
Mom!

344
00:54:30,988 --> 00:54:32,387
Hi, Simon, it's me!

345
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,287
I am in Mama's village.

346
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:36,222
I wish you were here with me.

347
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:37,259
Listen.

348
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:02,450
Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand.

349
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,283
I told you never to come here again!

350
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:43,615
Hello!

351
00:55:44,962 --> 00:55:45,951
Souha?

352
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,469
Ahmed loves you!
Ahmed loves you!

353
00:55:56,841 --> 00:55:59,901
I told you not to say that again!

354
00:56:02,646 --> 00:56:03,635
Hello.

355
00:56:04,148 --> 00:56:05,206
Can I help you?

356
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,187
Hello.

357
00:56:11,655 --> 00:56:15,989
Does anyone speak French
or English?

358
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,355
Where's Sami?

359
00:56:27,037 --> 00:56:29,028
Marhaba!
Marhaba!

360
00:56:30,074 --> 00:56:32,099
Hello!
Hello!

361
00:56:32,243 --> 00:56:33,232
Hello!

362
00:56:38,682 --> 00:56:40,115
Uh, Jeanne.

363
00:56:46,624 --> 00:56:47,921
Jeanne.

364
00:56:51,562 --> 00:56:52,893
Jeanne.

365
00:56:54,865 --> 00:56:56,230
Uh ...

366
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:01,860
Thank you.

367
00:57:17,421 --> 00:57:20,879
- You speak French?
- Yes, hello!

368
00:57:20,991 --> 00:57:22,390
Hello.

369
00:57:22,493 --> 00:57:24,961
My name is Samia.

370
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:27,393
I am Jeanne Marwan.

371
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:28,897
Thank you for helping me.

372
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:32,435
Marwan?
There are many Marwans here.

373
00:57:32,603 --> 00:57:34,093
Really?

374
00:57:35,472 --> 00:57:37,599
Well, I'm from Canada.

375
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:40,610
I'm looking for Souha.

376
00:57:40,778 --> 00:57:42,905
She is Souha.

377
00:57:43,013 --> 00:57:45,743
She is my great-grandmother.

378
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:48,443
- Oh! Marhaba!
- Marhaba.

379
00:57:54,959 --> 00:57:58,156
The people in the corner shop
told me to come see you.

380
00:58:04,602 --> 00:58:06,194
I am looking for my father.

381
00:58:06,337 --> 00:58:07,998
His name is Wahab.

382
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:17,042
Uh ...My mother's name
is Nawal Marwan.

383
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:20,009
She was born here.

384
00:58:28,025 --> 00:58:29,515
We do not know her.

385
00:58:30,694 --> 00:58:32,218
Of course you know her.

386
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:41,800
The Marwan family was struck with
shame.

388
00:58:59,823 --> 00:59:01,814
When the war came.

389
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,096
Uh, I'm looking for Wahab.

390
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:14,838
She does not know Wahab.

391
00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:23,842
I can not help you.
Sorry, I'm tired.

392
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:36,883
If you're Nawal Marwan daughter,

393
00:59:38,062 --> 00:59:41,088
you're not welcome here.

394
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:42,721
Go home.

395
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:49,136
She is looking for her father,

396
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:52,104
but she doesn't know
who is her mother.

397
01:02:26,063 --> 01:02:29,191
<i>I arrived at the end of the massacre
in the Deressa refugee camp.</i>

398
01:02:30,634 --> 01:02:32,568
<i>Everything was burning.</i>

399
01:02:34,438 --> 01:02:37,271
<i>I looked for my son amid
waves of blood.</i>

400
01:02:37,908 --> 01:02:42,106
<i>I was disheartened by what I saw
and heard.</i>

401
01:02:43,313 --> 01:02:45,543
You claim to be against
our enemy.

402
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:49,480
That does not make you our friend.

403
01:02:50,988 --> 01:02:53,548
Chamseddine. why would
he trust you?

404
01:02:54,825 --> 01:02:57,123
My son's father was
a refugee from Deressa.

405
01:02:57,294 --> 01:02:59,262
My son has been swallowed
by the war.

406
01:03:00,797 --> 01:03:02,924
I have nothing to lose.

407
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:07,827
My hatred is great toward
the Nationalists.

408
01:03:08,972 --> 01:03:12,271
This is not what you wrote
in Charbel's journal.

409
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:17,837
My uncle Charbel thought to encourage
peace with words and books.

410
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:20,974
I believed that.

411
01:03:23,487 --> 01:03:25,318
Life has taught me
something else.

412
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,922
What are you going to do now?

413
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:36,158
Teach the enemy what
life has taught me.

414
01:04:30,187 --> 01:04:32,348
That's goog. That's good.

415
01:04:32,522 --> 01:04:35,355
You've just forgotten it. Let's go.

416
01:04:40,263 --> 01:04:42,060
So in French?

417
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:46,195
I ... I am much better, Dad.

418
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,837
They say "a lot" or "best"

419
01:04:47,938 --> 01:04:50,668
but never both at the same
time, my darling.

420
01:04:53,543 --> 01:04:56,341
I want my son to learn to speak
several languages.

421
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:59,380
I want him to understand others
without an intermediary.

422
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:28,471
How are you, Nawal?
It's Nouchine.

423
01:05:29,646 --> 01:05:32,979
Good evening, Nouchine.
How's your mother?

424
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:36,950
My mother is very well.
10:00 o'clock tomorrow.

425
01:05:39,056 --> 01:05:40,751
Tomorrow.

426
01:06:30,307 --> 01:06:31,797
Marhaba.

427
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,958
Hello, beautiful.

428
01:06:58,135 --> 01:06:59,227
Good morning.

429
01:06:59,669 --> 01:07:01,398
Then you will be going out
with us on Thursday?

430
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:02,560
No.

431
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,172
Friday?

432
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:05,399
No.

433
01:07:05,575 --> 01:07:06,507
Saturday?

434
01:07:06,676 --> 01:07:07,973
No.

435
01:07:09,546 --> 01:07:11,673
We are patient!

436
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:13,315
Me too.

437
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:28,197
Never forget:

438
01:07:28,365 --> 01:07:30,356
"Always" is "always".

439
01:08:32,562 --> 01:08:33,551
Fucking bitch.

440
01:10:16,499 --> 01:10:18,694
The prison at Kfar
Ryat was comdemmed in

441
01:10:18,868 --> 01:10:21,735
several reports by Amnesty
International.

442
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,348
Here is the women's section.

443
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:35,578
The cells are larger.

444
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:38,882
Some prisoners remained
there up to 15 years.

445
01:10:48,398 --> 01:10:51,731
- It has existed since when?
- At the time of the massacres.

446
01:10:51,868 --> 01:10:53,699
Just after the war began.

447
01:10:53,803 --> 01:10:56,533
They have 600 political
prisoners jailed.

448
01:10:59,275 --> 01:11:00,606
You can come in, eh?

449
01:11:00,744 --> 01:11:02,268
I'll take a picture.

450
01:11:14,257 --> 01:11:15,986
You know this woman?

451
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:17,893
No.

452
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:20,224
She was imprisoned here.

453
01:11:22,132 --> 01:11:23,156
I don't know her.

454
01:11:23,299 --> 01:11:25,460
It was a really long time
ago, you know? I...

455
01:11:25,602 --> 01:11:28,571
Maybe you know someone
who worked here.

456
01:12:08,545 --> 01:12:09,773
Hello.

457
01:12:16,986 --> 01:12:18,180
Hello.

458
01:12:21,558 --> 01:12:23,992
I'm looking for Harrsa Fahim.

459
01:12:27,664 --> 01:12:30,656
I am the school janitor.

460
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,700
Yes, but before, what were you?

461
01:12:32,836 --> 01:12:35,236
Before, hum!

462
01:12:35,371 --> 01:12:38,238
That was before I became the
school janitor.

463
01:12:38,374 --> 01:12:41,673
It's been a long time since I'm
caretaker of the school.

464
01:12:43,913 --> 01:12:45,847
You know this woman?

465
01:12:46,015 --> 01:12:47,642
She was in Kfar Ryat.

466
01:12:50,587 --> 01:12:53,852
I am a school janitor.
Bess! That's all.

467
01:12:56,926 --> 01:12:59,053
I am looking for someone
who knew her.

468
01:12:59,195 --> 01:13:01,663
Someone who could
tell me about her.

469
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,667
This is my mother.

470
01:13:08,872 --> 01:13:11,739
This is the woman who sings.

471
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,001
Number 72.

472
01:13:15,178 --> 01:13:17,612
It was she who murdered the
militia leader

473
01:13:17,747 --> 01:13:19,214
of the christian right.

474
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:22,577
They made her pay dearly.

475
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,552
Very, very dearly.
Fifteen years.

476
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,460
They used to call her the
woman who sings

477
01:13:32,595 --> 01:13:34,756
because she sang all the time.

478
01:13:35,865 --> 01:13:37,890
Han, you are sure it's her?

479
01:13:38,968 --> 01:13:41,801
I spent 13 years as a watchman.

480
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:48,407
Have you ever spent 13 years
overseeing someone?

481
01:13:51,381 --> 01:13:53,941
They did everything
to make her break.

482
01:13:55,585 --> 01:13:59,646
In the end, she was
still standing,

483
01:13:59,789 --> 01:14:01,882
She looked ...

484
01:14:02,926 --> 01:14:04,757
Ah! Never seen anything like it.

485
01:14:04,928 --> 01:14:07,260
She never broke.

486
01:14:07,397 --> 01:14:10,230
It was exasperating.

487
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,102
And then they sent Abu Tarek.

488
01:14:20,276 --> 01:14:21,265
Who's that?

489
01:14:31,354 --> 01:14:33,481
Abu Tarek...

490
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:38,183
You know, sometimes it's better

491
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:40,853
not to know everything.

492
01:14:40,997 --> 01:14:42,965
Sir, I live with it anyway.

493
01:14:43,967 --> 01:14:45,457
Continue.

494
01:14:47,003 --> 01:14:48,197
Abu Tarek...

495
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:53,131
Abu Tarek was a investigation
specialist.

496
01:14:53,309 --> 01:14:55,470
He raped her repeatedly

497
01:14:55,645 --> 01:14:58,546
to break her before being
released.

498
01:14:58,681 --> 01:15:01,479
To stop her from singing.

499
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:08,650
Eventually she became pregnant.

500
01:15:10,226 --> 01:15:12,160
It was like that.

501
01:15:12,328 --> 01:15:14,489
I'll never forget it.

502
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:18,122
Number 72 pregnant by Abu Tarek.

503
01:15:20,036 --> 01:15:21,663
They waited ...

504
01:15:21,804 --> 01:15:24,295
for her to give birth in prison

505
01:15:24,407 --> 01:15:27,376
then they let her go.

506
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,478
The child?
Did you see the child?

507
01:15:35,685 --> 01:15:39,086
There was a doctor who came
sometimes.

508
01:15:40,089 --> 01:15:42,182
I think he's crazy.

509
01:15:42,358 --> 01:15:45,691
Others say he has a restaurant
in Tel Aviv ...

510
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,363
That's bullshit.

511
01:15:49,499 --> 01:15:52,195
He went mad and died.

512
01:15:52,368 --> 01:15:55,735
His nurse, I know her.

513
01:15:55,872 --> 01:15:58,033
She lives in Daresh.

514
01:16:01,077 --> 01:16:02,567
In Daresh?

515
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,619
Listen, Simon, I'm calling you!

516
01:16:12,755 --> 01:16:15,952
I'm calling you, no, shut up, OK?
Shut your mouth!

517
01:16:16,092 --> 01:16:18,583
Mom, she was in prison.
Simon, mom, she ...

518
01:16:19,862 --> 01:16:21,727
Mom, she was raped.

519
01:16:23,232 --> 01:16:25,291
Our brother, she had him in prison.

520
01:16:27,103 --> 01:16:28,968
I need you here.

521
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,900
THE WOMAN THAT SINGS

521
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:31,584
This, Simon, are notary Amyott
contracts

522
01:19:31,754 --> 01:19:32,743
from 1868 to 1892.

523
01:19:32,889 --> 01:19:36,222
His son took over, Édouard,
until 1925.

524
01:19:36,325 --> 01:19:38,657
All the contracts are hand-written.

525
01:19:38,794 --> 01:19:41,558
My grandfather, Charles,
my father, Henry.

526
01:19:41,664 --> 01:19:43,131
And me.

527
01:19:43,266 --> 01:19:45,962
Yeah, well, it stops there
because as you know,

528
01:19:46,102 --> 01:19:47,467
I am the last of the Lebel.

529
01:19:47,603 --> 01:19:50,003
I'll show you the
will of a man ...

530
01:19:52,942 --> 01:19:54,773
... which took several lives.

531
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,979
His heirs have discovered

532
01:19:59,115 --> 01:20:00,946
he had three wives, all
at the same time.

533
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:02,107
One here, one in Miami,

534
01:20:02,285 --> 01:20:04,947
and another in Honduras,
where he did business.

535
01:20:06,355 --> 01:20:10,189
No, no ...he not longer has
three children in the file there, no

536
01:20:10,326 --> 01:20:11,293
There are eight.

537
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,655
That is sport, my man.

538
01:20:15,464 --> 01:20:17,329
Look. Hum!

539
01:20:19,368 --> 01:20:21,859
Death is never the
end of a story.

540
01:20:22,004 --> 01:20:23,699
There are still traces.

541
01:20:26,142 --> 01:20:27,871
If you want to find
your brother,

542
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:30,444
you'll have to go back into
your mother's past.

543
01:20:30,546 --> 01:20:33,140
Jean, I'm going to fetch my
sister, that's all.

544
01:20:33,282 --> 01:20:34,214
I'll take care of that.

545
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:36,545
Two, three small matters
to take care,

546
01:20:36,686 --> 01:20:38,153
then it will take no time.

547
01:20:38,321 --> 01:20:40,050
Well, get your business ready

548
01:20:40,189 --> 01:20:41,451
we should go in ...

549
01:20:41,557 --> 01:20:43,457
My passport ...

550
01:20:43,559 --> 01:20:46,995
"We"? Don't you worry that
you already done enough already

551
01:20:47,129 --> 01:20:50,326
Exactly, this is not the
time to let you down.

552
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:53,996
Make a man out of you, Simon.

553
01:20:54,136 --> 01:20:56,331
I know that you need me.

554
01:20:59,141 --> 01:21:00,733
We'll get it, then come back.

555
01:21:00,876 --> 01:21:02,241
I promise.

556
01:21:02,378 --> 01:21:04,403
Then, promise, Mr. Marwan,

557
01:21:04,547 --> 01:21:07,710
a notary is on the order
of the sacred.

558
01:24:03,692 --> 01:24:05,819
Sing now.

559
01:25:12,628 --> 01:25:14,994
Gently, gently.

560
01:25:17,132 --> 01:25:18,497
He is coming out.

561
01:25:18,901 --> 01:25:20,300
We can see the head.

562
01:25:20,469 --> 01:25:21,834
Push, push.

563
01:25:22,471 --> 01:25:24,063
Go, girl.

564
01:25:32,414 --> 01:25:34,006
The first came out.

565
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:58,201
Rest now ...

566
01:25:59,308 --> 01:26:00,673
I'm proud of you.

567
01:26:02,611 --> 01:26:04,636
Get ready for the second.

568
01:26:34,076 --> 01:26:35,338
Stop.

569
01:26:35,577 --> 01:26:36,908
Stop.

570
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,012
What are you doing?

571
01:26:39,348 --> 01:26:41,578
You are going to dump them in the
river as usual.

572
01:26:43,385 --> 01:26:44,682
- It's dangerous.
- No.

573
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:48,756
You've done your duty.
Throw them in the river.

574
01:26:48,924 --> 01:26:50,551
I want to take care of them.

575
01:26:51,026 --> 01:26:53,586
These are the children of
the woman who sings.

576
01:27:13,582 --> 01:27:16,710
Oh, this country is a war
zone after another, eh!

577
01:27:16,885 --> 01:27:17,943
It's not complicated.

578
01:27:18,087 --> 01:27:20,578
If the notary had existed
at the time of Noah,

579
01:27:20,723 --> 01:27:21,883
we would not be here.

580
01:27:22,024 --> 01:27:24,788
We need only to find the
original contracts.

581
01:27:24,927 --> 01:27:28,556
That's up to you, that's up to you.
And a right of passage there.

582
01:27:28,697 --> 01:27:29,686
And we talk more about it.

583
01:27:29,798 --> 01:27:31,231
Everyone would be happy.

584
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,198
Notaries have existed
only in the last 1,000 years, Simon.

585
01:27:34,303 --> 01:27:35,964
That's the problem.

586
01:27:36,105 --> 01:27:38,232
I should have been here from
the beginning.

587
01:27:38,374 --> 01:27:41,104
Thank you again for your
help, Me Maddad.

588
01:27:41,243 --> 01:27:43,768
The pleasure is all
mine, my dear fellow.

589
01:27:43,912 --> 01:27:45,573
I have the result

590
01:27:45,714 --> 01:27:47,648
that you have requested
via email.

591
01:27:47,783 --> 01:27:50,411
Simon my file on
the seat beside you.

592
01:27:50,552 --> 01:27:53,385
Could you give it to
Lebel, please?

593
01:27:53,489 --> 01:27:56,424
You are very nice, but the
delay and everything ...

594
01:27:56,558 --> 01:27:58,822
I think I'll wait until later.

595
01:27:58,961 --> 01:28:00,155
But I'll summarize.

596
01:28:00,295 --> 01:28:01,922
For the father, it is
rather difficult

597
01:28:02,097 --> 01:28:03,997
because I can not find
the death certificate.

598
01:28:04,133 --> 01:28:05,100
For the brother ...

599
01:28:05,234 --> 01:28:07,099
Excuse me, but what
are we talking about here?

600
01:28:07,269 --> 01:28:08,930
I asked for help, Simon.

601
01:28:09,104 --> 01:28:11,834
Me Maddad kindly gave us a hand

602
01:28:11,974 --> 01:28:13,305
to speed things up.

603
01:28:13,442 --> 01:28:16,741
I told you, Jean,
we came for Jeanne.

604
01:28:18,113 --> 01:28:20,775
Your sister is the one person
in your family

605
01:28:20,949 --> 01:28:22,348
easiest to find.

606
01:28:29,525 --> 01:28:31,993
I'm so glad you're here.

607
01:28:32,127 --> 01:28:34,288
Me too.

608
01:28:40,836 --> 01:28:42,804
OK, that's the nurse's name.

609
01:28:42,971 --> 01:28:44,802
which helped your mother give birth
in prison.

610
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,498
We can go today.

611
01:28:47,509 --> 01:28:49,807
Jeanne, that's enough.

612
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,648
No, you shut up, then follow me.

613
01:28:53,816 --> 01:28:56,717
It's your job to find our
brother, not mine!

614
01:28:56,852 --> 01:28:59,150
Then, if you don't do it for
her or for you,

615
01:28:59,321 --> 01:29:01,016
the, do it for me!

616
01:29:07,196 --> 01:29:08,993
She is at the American hospital.

617
01:29:15,137 --> 01:29:16,900
I'm glad you're here, Jean.

618
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:18,973
Me too, my owl, me too.

619
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:22,340
If she is sleeping, you must return
later.

620
01:29:46,768 --> 01:29:48,258
Ms. Maika?

621
01:30:17,026 --> 01:30:20,189
Lebel, Jeanne Marwan,
Simon Marwan.

622
01:30:20,363 --> 01:30:21,728
Bonjour, Madame!

623
01:30:21,864 --> 01:30:23,354
Thank you for having us.

624
01:30:23,532 --> 01:30:26,365
We seek someone you know.

625
01:30:26,502 --> 01:30:28,732
Nawal Marwan, do you know her?

626
01:30:56,899 --> 01:30:59,766
You worked in the Kfar Ryat prison
as a nurse?

627
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,548
She says she knows your mom.

628
01:31:17,753 --> 01:31:19,983
You helped our mother
give birth in prison?

629
01:31:24,593 --> 01:31:25,924
Yes.

630
01:31:32,568 --> 01:31:36,265
Madame, the child we seek is Nawal
Marwan's son that was born in prison.

631
01:31:36,439 --> 01:31:37,838
Can you help us?

632
01:31:41,477 --> 01:31:44,810
She worked in the prison
of Kfar Ryat.

633
01:31:45,948 --> 01:31:48,508
She assisted her
during childbirth.

634
01:31:49,952 --> 01:31:51,943
She gathered the children.

635
01:31:58,761 --> 01:32:01,423
Then she gave them back
to the woman who sings

636
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:03,464
when she got out of prison.

637
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:06,794
Nawal Marwan gave
birth to twins.

638
01:32:09,705 --> 01:32:11,172
Hush, hush, hush.

639
01:32:13,275 --> 01:32:15,140
Hush, hush, hush.

640
01:36:21,724 --> 01:36:24,386
You really know the
woman who sings?

641
01:36:24,526 --> 01:36:27,552
You don't know what
it means to me.

642
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:30,699
Nawal Marwan worked for me

643
01:36:30,799 --> 01:36:32,391
as a secretary for 18 years.

644
01:36:32,534 --> 01:36:34,764
My wife and I, we had
taken a liking

645
01:36:34,903 --> 01:36:36,393
to her and her children.

646
01:36:37,406 --> 01:36:38,737
But I confess that I

647
01:36:38,907 --> 01:36:41,398
didn't really know her till the end.

648
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:46,240
- Ready?
- Ready.

649
01:36:58,293 --> 01:36:59,783
Hmm ...

650
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:03,921
Me Maddadi has conducted an
investigation, at my request,

651
01:37:04,099 --> 01:37:07,262
to track your brother
and your father.

652
01:37:12,775 --> 01:37:14,402
For the father, Abu Tarek,

653
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:17,274
I still have not found
a death certificate.

654
01:37:17,446 --> 01:37:19,573
The country has a lot
of certificates missing.

655
01:37:19,681 --> 01:37:21,911
He could have gone abroad.

656
01:37:22,017 --> 01:37:25,316
That's what happened with
this kind of characters.

657
01:37:25,454 --> 01:37:26,853
They are dead or have disappeared.

658
01:37:26,989 --> 01:37:28,115
You have to see.

659
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:30,451
Maybe it's better that way.

660
01:37:31,493 --> 01:37:33,859
For the brother ...

661
01:37:33,996 --> 01:37:36,294
your client, Ms. Nawal Marwan,

662
01:37:36,431 --> 01:37:38,296
comes from the village
of Der Om.

663
01:37:38,467 --> 01:37:42,699
She gave the child to a midwife
who's named Elham

664
01:37:42,838 --> 01:37:46,638
who herself returned it to
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

665
01:37:46,809 --> 01:37:49,141
in May 1970.

666
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:53,346
The main task was to
trace the registry records.

667
01:37:53,482 --> 01:37:56,042
Many documents have been
lost in the war.

668
01:37:57,052 --> 01:37:59,646
But I found the records

669
01:37:59,788 --> 01:38:02,052
which were recovered and donated

670
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:06,321
by the Sisters of Charity
to the National Archives.

671
01:38:06,461 --> 01:38:10,158
In May 1970, the midwife at
Der Om, Elham

672
01:38:10,332 --> 01:38:13,165
filed a petition for adoption
of a male child.

673
01:38:13,302 --> 01:38:17,966
This is the only boy in the
orphanage filed in that month.

674
01:38:18,073 --> 01:38:19,404
Look.

675
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:22,704
It was registered under
the name Nihad.

676
01:38:24,546 --> 01:38:26,673
The dates match.

677
01:38:26,815 --> 01:38:28,305
That's him.

678
01:38:29,318 --> 01:38:32,481
Ha! It's your brother! Nihad.

679
01:38:36,024 --> 01:38:38,015
Orphanage Kfar Kout,

680
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,218
Nihad May.

681
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:42,421
It's his name in the registry.

682
01:38:42,564 --> 01:38:43,758
Nihad from the month of May.

683
01:38:43,899 --> 01:38:46,333
They gave him a temporary name

684
01:38:46,435 --> 01:38:47,766
with the month of arrival.

685
01:38:47,903 --> 01:38:50,929
There was no adoption
during that period.

686
01:38:51,073 --> 01:38:52,870
It was the beginning of the war.

687
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:55,771
The orphanage was destroyed
four years later.

688
01:38:57,045 --> 01:38:59,707
We must ask those that destroyed
the orphanage in Kfar Kout

689
01:38:59,848 --> 01:39:02,715
to know what happened
to the children.

690
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:08,383
Between you and me, with what
happened in the region ...

691
01:39:09,391 --> 01:39:10,881
there is not much hope.

692
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:14,386
They are probably also dead.

693
01:39:14,529 --> 01:39:16,588
I'm not saying they're dead.

694
01:39:16,732 --> 01:39:18,859
I say we lost track of them.

695
01:39:20,569 --> 01:39:22,400
They are both dead.

696
01:39:22,537 --> 01:39:24,971
We open the envelopes,
that's it, then.

697
01:39:25,107 --> 01:39:26,938
That I will not allow, Simon.

698
01:39:27,075 --> 01:39:28,906
This kind of thing is sacred.

700
01:39:32,748 --> 01:39:34,943
Luckily, I have a history.

701
01:39:37,653 --> 01:39:39,746
Excuse me.

702
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:43,483
It is still worth exploring.

703
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:46,890
But it is a little radical.

704
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:48,897
The warlord

705
01:39:48,997 --> 01:39:51,625
that demolished the orphanage
at that time is still alive.

706
01:39:51,767 --> 01:39:53,826
And he may know what happened

707
01:39:53,969 --> 01:39:56,164
to Nihad's children and where
they went.

708
01:39:56,305 --> 01:39:57,499
It's already been an eternity.

709
01:39:57,639 --> 01:39:59,300
You must understand

710
01:39:59,441 --> 01:40:02,638
that during this period there were
a series of reprisals

711
01:40:02,778 --> 01:40:06,305
which fit one another in
a sort of inexorable logic,

713
01:40:10,285 --> 01:40:12,253
A warlord is exactly

714
01:40:12,354 --> 01:40:14,515
the type of man who
has a long memory.

715
01:40:14,656 --> 01:40:16,988
And he will remember, believe me.

716
01:40:18,427 --> 01:40:20,258
Wallat Chamseddine,

717
01:40:20,362 --> 01:40:21,795
is his name.

718
01:40:26,101 --> 01:40:27,466
We can find him here?

719
01:40:27,602 --> 01:40:30,594
If we don't find him, he
will find us.

720
01:40:33,475 --> 01:40:35,500
But we can try something.

721
01:40:37,346 --> 01:40:40,008
Would you like tea, Mr. Marwan?

722
01:40:44,019 --> 01:40:45,987
It's your turn.

723
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:51,187
You will go

724
01:40:51,326 --> 01:40:53,317
to the Deressa refugee camp.

725
01:40:53,495 --> 01:40:54,962
You will come to tea

726
01:40:55,063 --> 01:40:56,325
anywhere in the camp

727
01:40:56,498 --> 01:40:58,363
with the person that invite you.

728
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,492
And you say you are the son
of the woman who sings

729
01:41:01,636 --> 01:41:03,501
and are looking Nihad May.

730
01:41:03,672 --> 01:41:05,799
You can not go there alone.

731
01:41:07,075 --> 01:41:09,168
I'll find someone

732
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:10,835
to accompany you.

733
01:41:32,934 --> 01:41:34,697
Welcome to Deressa.

734
01:42:43,271 --> 01:42:45,102
Ha! Ha! You know where you
are going, Simon?

735
01:42:45,273 --> 01:42:46,672
I know.

736
01:43:13,034 --> 01:43:14,262
How are you?

737
01:43:15,604 --> 01:43:17,094
In the name of God, you've grown!

738
01:43:17,272 --> 01:43:20,036
I have finished my engineering studies.

739
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:24,838
I cannot find work, so I'm
a taxi driver now.

740
01:43:25,013 --> 01:43:27,038
What brings you here?

741
01:43:27,215 --> 01:43:32,278
I am with some foreign visitors, who
asked me to bring them here.

742
01:43:34,156 --> 01:43:36,021
Welcome, come.

743
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:38,523
No, thank you, we're
in a hurry.

744
01:43:38,693 --> 01:43:40,524
Please, come.

745
01:43:45,834 --> 01:43:48,564
He is inviting us to tea.

746
01:43:48,703 --> 01:43:49,829
Oh, good!

747
01:44:07,055 --> 01:44:10,889
Uh, I wonder why you have
come to Deressa.

748
01:44:14,029 --> 01:44:16,520
I am looking for someone
named Nihad de Mai.

749
01:44:25,874 --> 01:44:28,866
He does not know Nihad de Mai.

750
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:32,207
He asks me what are your names.

751
01:44:39,554 --> 01:44:42,387
My mother comes from the village
of Der de Om, in the South.

752
01:44:55,637 --> 01:44:57,730
My mother is the woman who sings.

753
01:45:23,131 --> 01:45:25,224
Yes, that's fine. Done.

754
01:45:30,405 --> 01:45:31,963
Wait for what?

755
01:46:05,307 --> 01:46:07,275
- Sarwan Marwan?
- Yes.

756
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:09,707
We are here to offer help.

757
01:46:09,844 --> 01:46:12,142
You will be back in an hour.

758
01:46:13,381 --> 01:46:14,871
Can I tell my sister?

759
01:46:15,016 --> 01:46:18,042
No, you'll be back in
an hour, I promise.

760
01:46:19,521 --> 01:46:21,989
I'll put on a shirt, just a second.

761
01:46:24,793 --> 01:46:25,987
He will call.

762
01:46:26,361 --> 01:46:27,726
He's going to go.

763
01:46:28,396 --> 01:46:31,229
Ok! Do not worry, you can follow.

764
01:46:31,366 --> 01:46:34,802
Ah, I told you: the South,
a spark and it exploded.

765
01:46:35,003 --> 01:46:36,402
Oh, okay.

766
01:47:50,645 --> 01:47:53,910
You have been luck with us,
we'll help in our own way.

767
01:47:55,283 --> 01:47:56,807
You must leave the country.

768
01:47:56,985 --> 01:47:58,714
It'll be easier.

769
01:47:58,887 --> 01:48:01,321
We will find you a house and a job.

770
01:48:02,257 --> 01:48:05,249
I want your life to be better.

771
01:48:07,061 --> 01:48:09,825
We have many contacts
in America.

772
01:48:11,633 --> 01:48:13,828
You gotta go with your children.

773
01:48:14,436 --> 01:48:17,269
I know they are alive.
Take them with you.

774
01:48:20,442 --> 01:48:24,105
The children will help
you, you'll see.

775
01:48:30,919 --> 01:48:33,854
You cannot ask me.

776
01:48:35,690 --> 01:48:37,988
Your children are our
children, Nawal.

777
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,286
Your family is our family.

778
01:48:40,795 --> 01:48:41,989
Trust me.

779
01:48:43,431 --> 01:48:46,366
I'll help you.

780
01:48:46,534 --> 01:48:49,867
I'm here for you and
your children.

781
01:49:39,387 --> 01:49:40,877
Hello, Sarwan.

782
01:49:43,024 --> 01:49:46,687
Excuse my introduction, but
it is for your protection.

783
01:49:48,863 --> 01:49:51,764
They call me Wallat Chamseddine.

784
01:49:54,168 --> 01:49:58,502
Tell me, what can I do to
help, Sarwan Marwan?

785
01:50:00,241 --> 01:50:02,004
You knew my mother.

786
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:04,738
They say she worked for me.

787
01:50:04,879 --> 01:50:07,905
What can I do to help?

788
01:50:11,886 --> 01:50:15,219
I am looking for a
man named Nihad de Mai.

789
01:50:16,257 --> 01:50:18,384
Why you are looking for Nihad de Mai?

790
01:50:20,395 --> 01:50:21,453
He's my brother.

791
01:50:21,596 --> 01:50:24,087
My mother asked me to find him.

792
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,631
And how can you prove that

793
01:50:27,769 --> 01:50:30,795
Nihad de Mai is the son
of Nawal Marwan?

794
01:50:33,575 --> 01:50:35,372
My brother was
placed for adoption

795
01:50:35,476 --> 01:50:37,239
at the Kfar Kout orphanage.

796
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,549
We found the registry with
the original file.

797
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:44,211
The dates ... Everything fits.

798
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:46,549
Nihad de Mai is my brother.

799
01:51:29,797 --> 01:51:31,856
Me and my friends, we attacked

800
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,332
the christian village at Kfar Kout ...

801
01:51:35,336 --> 01:51:36,803
In response to attacks

802
01:51:36,971 --> 01:51:39,804
that our brothers, the refugees,
were victims of.

803
01:51:41,442 --> 01:51:44,536
There was an orphanage
in Kfar Kout.

804
01:51:45,613 --> 01:51:47,672
I saved the children.

805
01:51:47,815 --> 01:51:49,942
I took them with us.

806
01:51:50,051 --> 01:51:52,952
And Nihad was among them.

807
01:51:53,054 --> 01:51:54,988
We have trained and prepared

808
01:51:55,156 --> 01:51:57,351
them so that they can fight
alongside us.

809
01:51:58,559 --> 01:52:00,823
Nihad, he had a gift.

810
01:52:00,995 --> 01:52:03,486
He was at unique.

811
01:52:03,665 --> 01:52:06,828
And soon it became a
formidable fencer.

812
01:52:08,136 --> 01:52:12,664
But he wanted to
find her mother.

813
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,808
He sought her for a long time.

814
01:52:16,244 --> 01:52:19,509
Nihad, I do not know what
he saw or heard.

815
01:52:20,515 --> 01:52:22,005
He started ...

816
01:52:23,184 --> 01:52:25,516
a crazy war.

817
01:52:25,687 --> 01:52:29,589
He came to see me, he
wanted to be a martyr

818
01:52:29,724 --> 01:52:32,192
so that his mother should see
his picture everywhere

819
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:33,657
on the walls around the country.

820
01:52:34,896 --> 01:52:36,523
But I refused.

821
01:52:38,433 --> 01:52:40,424
He went back to Daresh.

822
01:52:41,502 --> 01:52:43,663
He became a maverick,

823
01:52:43,771 --> 01:52:46,035
one of the most dangerous  in the region.

824
01:52:46,207 --> 01:52:47,401
A real machine.

825
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:49,407
He pulls on everyone.

826
01:52:49,544 --> 01:52:53,947
And then there was the
enemy invasion.

827
01:52:55,349 --> 01:52:56,839
And one morning ...

828
01:52:57,852 --> 01:52:59,786
They captured Nihad.

829
01:52:59,921 --> 01:53:01,718
He killed seven gunmen.

830
01:53:03,791 --> 01:53:05,554
They did not killed them.

831
01:53:05,693 --> 01:53:07,058
They captured him

832
01:53:07,195 --> 01:53:09,891
and sent him to the prison
in Kfar Ryat.

833
01:53:11,265 --> 01:53:12,960
He has been in prison?

834
01:53:13,101 --> 01:53:14,568
Yes.

835
01:53:16,938 --> 01:53:18,371
He is the executioner.

836
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:22,441
He worked with my father?

837
01:53:22,577 --> 01:53:24,545
- No, he did not work

838
01:53:24,645 --> 01:53:26,579
with Abu Tarek, your father.

839
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:57,077
- Are you okay?

840
01:54:01,749 --> 01:54:03,239
One plus one ...

841
01:54:04,252 --> 01:54:06,117
that makes two.

842
01:54:06,254 --> 01:54:07,744
What?

843
01:54:10,792 --> 01:54:12,851
One plus one makes two.

844
01:54:13,861 --> 01:54:15,351
You can not make one.

845
01:54:21,969 --> 01:54:23,766
Hey, you have a fever.

846
01:54:26,174 --> 01:54:27,664
Jeanne?

847
01:54:29,544 --> 01:54:32,172
One plus one, does it make one?

848
01:54:53,835 --> 01:54:55,700
Are there are empty seats, no.

849
01:54:55,837 --> 01:54:57,168
Oh, move ahead if you want.

850
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:28,326
Can I help you, ma'am?

851
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:38,438
Excuse me.

852
01:57:48,809 --> 01:57:51,175
<i>By becoming a hangman</i>

853
01:57:51,312 --> 01:57:53,803
<i>your brother has changed
its name.</i>

854
01:57:53,914 --> 01:57:56,474
<i>He became Abu Tarek.</i>

855
01:57:59,387 --> 01:58:02,356
<i>Nihad de Mai is Abu Tarek.</i>

856
01:58:06,594 --> 01:58:09,062
<i>We know that he now lives in Canada</i>

857
01:58:09,196 --> 01:58:11,221
<i>under a new identity.</i>

858
01:58:11,365 --> 01:58:13,856
<i>Nihad Harmanni.</i>

859
01:58:52,373 --> 01:58:53,863
Mr. Harmanni?

860
01:58:57,111 --> 01:58:58,078
Yes?

861
01:59:05,586 --> 01:59:07,076
This is for you.

862
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:55,796
<i>My hand is shaking while
I am writing this.</i>

863
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:57,528
<i>I recognized you.</i>

864
01:59:57,671 --> 02:00:00,299
<i>But you didn't.</i>

865
02:00:00,474 --> 02:00:02,339
<i>It's a wonderful miracle.</i>

866
02:00:02,476 --> 02:00:04,137
<i>I'm your number 72.</i>

867
02:00:04,278 --> 02:00:08,544
<i>This letter will be delivered
by our children.</i>

868
02:00:08,682 --> 02:00:10,673
<i>You will not recognize them</i>

869
02:00:10,818 --> 02:00:12,649
<i>because they are beautiful,</i>

870
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:15,152
<i>but they know who you are.</i>

871
02:00:23,831 --> 02:00:26,061
<i>Through them, I want to tell you</i>

872
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,168
<i>you're still alive.</i>

873
02:00:28,335 --> 02:00:30,326
<i>But soon, you'll be quiet.</i>

874
02:00:30,504 --> 02:00:31,994
<i>I know.</i>

875
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:36,002
<i>Because silence is
all to the truth.</i>

876
02:00:37,011 --> 02:00:40,071
<i>Signed: The whore 72.</i>

877
02:00:53,727 --> 02:00:56,389
<i>I speak to my son.</i>

878
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:58,555
<i>I am not talking to
the executioner.</i>

879
02:00:58,699 --> 02:01:01,668
<i>Whatever happens, I will
always love you.</i>

880
02:01:01,769 --> 02:01:07,002
<i>That's the promise I made you
at birth, my son.</i>

881
02:01:07,107 --> 02:01:10,372
<i>Whatever happens, I will
always love you.</i>

882
02:01:11,512 --> 02:01:13,912
<i>I've searched my whole life.</i>

883
02:01:14,048 --> 02:01:16,539
<i>I found you.</i>

884
02:01:16,684 --> 02:01:20,211
<i>You, you could not recognize me.</i>

885
02:01:20,387 --> 02:01:23,185
<i>You have your tattoo
on the right heel.</i>

886
02:01:23,290 --> 02:01:24,689
<i>I've seen it.</i>

887
02:01:24,792 --> 02:01:25,850
<i>I recognized you.</i>

888
02:01:27,361 --> 02:01:29,795
<i>And I found you beautiful.</i>

889
02:01:29,930 --> 02:01:33,297
<i>I'll remember you with all the
sweetness of the world, my love.</i>

890
02:01:33,434 --> 02:01:36,926
<i>Console yourself because nothing
is more beautiful</i>

891
02:01:37,071 --> 02:01:38,732
<i>than being together.</i>

892
02:01:38,906 --> 02:01:40,567
<i>You were born of love.</i>

893
02:01:40,708 --> 02:01:45,042
<i>Your brother and your sister
were also born of love.</i>

894
02:01:46,714 --> 02:01:50,081
<i>Nothing is more beautiful
than to be together.

895
02:01:50,251 --> 02:01:53,243
<i>Your mother, Nawal Marwan.</i>

896
02:01:54,255 --> 02:01:56,621
<i>Prisoner number 72.</i>

897
02:02:04,932 --> 02:02:06,991
"When these envelopes
have been handed

898
02:02:07,134 --> 02:02:08,499
"to the addressee,

899
02:02:08,636 --> 02:02:10,263
"You will be given a letter."

02:02:10,404 --> 02:02:11,598
"The silence will be broken,

"A stone may then be placed
on my grave,

the stone facing the sun."

904
02:02:39,466 --> 02:02:42,299
<i>My love ...</i>

905
02:02:42,469 --> 02:02:44,369
<i>Where did your story begin?</i>

906
02:02:45,639 --> 02:02:48,301
<i>When you were born?</i>

907
02:02:48,475 --> 02:02:50,670
<i>Then she starts in horror.</i>

908
02:02:51,879 --> 02:02:55,007
<i>At the birth of your father?</i>

909
02:02:55,149 --> 02:02:58,346
<i>Then she begins a
great love story.</i>

910
02:03:00,387 --> 02:03:03,879
<i>I say that your story
begins with a promise</i>

911
02:03:04,024 --> 02:03:06,458
<i>that will break
the thread of anger.</i>

912
02:03:08,329 --> 02:03:11,662
<i>Thanks to you, today I finally
managed to do it.</i>

913
02:03:11,832 --> 02:03:13,800
<i>The thread is broken.</i>

914
02:03:13,901 --> 02:03:16,836
<i>And I can finally take
the time to rock you in my arms...</i>

915
02:03:18,205 --> 02:03:20,366
and softly sing you a lullaby</i>

916

<i>I love you.</i>

919
02:03:29,883 --> 02:03:33,046
<i>Your mother, Nawal.</i>
